## Welcome

Hi, my name is Adam and I enjoy thinking about big ideas. I am a <strong>Computer Scientist</strong> by degree, an aspiring <strong>Speaker Designer</strong>, and a lifelong <strong>Tinkerer</strong>. 

I enjoy speaker design and fabrication, hiking, camping, programming, motorbikes, cars, and music. 

This website is a collection of things I find interesting and have had time to write about. If you'd like to talk about anything you can find my contact details in the footer below.
